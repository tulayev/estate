    'client_review_1' => 'I want to express my immense gratitude to Ignatev Estate Co., Ltd. I do not regret turning to this agency.
A huge thank you to the very high-level professional, Pavel Ignatyev! Despite the fact that the case was very complex and previously I had to turn to several agencies,
no one wanted to take on solving this task. A contract with very inflexible terms was concluded many years ago, and it was not possible to make changes.
But! A non-standard approach to withdrawing the devices from the rental pool and the most complex task was solved!
Thank you for your competent and responsible approach to work. I recommend everyone who wants to work with professionals in their field!',

    'client_name_2' => 'Grigory Ivanov',
    'client_review_2' => 'I recommend this company 100%! True professionals in their field!
We have been renting in Phuket for three years in a row, and every time everything was at the highest level: from selecting housing to small details like fresh produce in the fridge upon our arrival.
When the question of buying property in Phuket arose, the choice was obvious. Pavel provided a detailed market analysis and clearly and accessibly answered all questions. After two years, I can confidently say that the decision was correct — we are more than satisfied!
If you are looking for property in Phuket, do not hesitate — contact this company! Thank you very much for your professionalism and care!',

    'client_name_3' => 'Aleksandra Lipatova',
    'client_review_3' => 'We rented a two-bedroom apartment in Ocean Stone 614 in Phuket, Bang Tao area for a month. Firstly, prompt feedback during the booking process, recommendations on location. The apartment has an ideal location! Within walking distance (10 min) is the beach at the Dusit hotel, restaurants, and shops are also about 10 minutes away on foot. Everything in the apartment works! Good air conditioners, washing machine, stove, microwave. Cleaning with towel and linen change twice a week. Thank you for the vacation, we were satisfied, and we really want to come back again!',

    'client_name_4' => 'Anzhela Danishevskaya',
    'client_review_4' => 'I am very glad that fate brought me together with this agency a year and a half ago, special thanks to Pavel and Olga, they saved my investments from an object that turned out to be very problematic during the document check. I initially chose the object myself, based on the recommendation and beautiful advertising of the developer, but decided to recheck everything with an independent real estate agency and, as it turned out, not in vain. In the end, we chose a different object with Pavel, which will be completed in two months. My first problematic object, by the way, has not been completed to this day.',
