                            Our journey with Phuket's off-plan real estate market began in
                            2017, not as service providers, but as investors. Despite the
                            market's growth potential, we quickly discovered significant
                            flaws that made navigating this landscape challenging.
                            Overpriced properties, hidden gems lost in the noise, and a
                            lack of transparent, reliable information were just a few of
                            the obstacles we encountered. As investors ourselves, we felt
                            the pressing need for a more structured, transparent
                            data-driven approach to off-plan investment.
